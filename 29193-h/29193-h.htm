longer a new-comer to either this magazine or to this field, describes
a strange little town that you, yourself, may blunder into one of these
evenings. But, if you do, beware&mdash;beware of the Knights!</small></i></p></div>

<h2><small><i>by ... HENRY SLESAR</i></small></h2>

<p class="pr1"><big><b>The woman in the doorway looked so harmless. Who
was to tell she had some rather startling interests?</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">The</span> woman in the
doorway looked like Mom in
the homier political cartoons.
She was plump, apple-cheeked,
white-haired. She
wore a fussy, old-fashioned
nightgown, and was busily
clutching a worn house-robe
around her expansive middle.
She blinked at Sol Becker's
rain-flattened hair and hang-dog
expression, and said:
"What is it? What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;" Sol's voice
was pained. "The man in the
diner said you might put me
up. I had my car stolen: a
hitchhiker; going to Salinas ..."
He was puffing.</p>

<p>"Hitchhiker? I don't understand."
She clucked at the
sight of the pool of water he
was creating in her foyer.
"Well, come inside, for heaven's
sake. You're soaking!"</p>

<p>"Thanks," Sol said gratefully.</p>

<p>With the door firmly shut
behind him, the warm interior
of the little house covered
him like a blanket. He
shivered, and let the warmth
seep over him. "I'm terribly
sorry. I know how late it is."
He looked at his watch, but
the face was too misty to
make out the hour.</p>

<p>"Must be nearly three," the
woman sniffed. "You couldn't
have come at a worse time. I
was just on my way to
court&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words slid by him. "If
I could just stay overnight.
Until the morning. I could
call some friends in San Fernando.
I'm very susceptible to
head colds," he added inanely.</p>

<p>"Well, take those shoes off,
first," the woman grumbled.
"You can undress in the parlor,
if you'll keep off the rug.
You won't mind using the
sofa?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. I'd be
happy to pay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, tush, nobody's asking
you to pay. This isn't a hotel.
You mind if I go back upstairs?
They're gonna miss
me at the palace."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," Sol
said. He followed her into
the darkened parlor, and
watched as she turned the
screw on a hurricane-style
lamp, shedding a yellow pool
of light over half a flowery
sofa and a doily-covered wing
chair. "You go on up. I'll be
perfectly fine."</p>

<p>"Guess you can use a towel,
though. I'll get you one,
then I'm going up. We wake
pretty early in this house.
Breakfast's at seven; you'll
have to be up if you want
any."</p>

<p>"I really can't thank you
enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tush," the woman said.
She scurried out, and returned
a moment later with a
thick bath towel. "Sorry I
can't give you any bedding.
But you'll find it nice and
warm in here." She squinted
at the dim face of a ship's-wheel
clock on the mantle,
and made a noise with her
tongue. "Three-thirty!" she
exclaimed. "I'll miss the
whole execution ..."</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"Goodnight, young man,"
Mom said firmly.</p>

<p>She padded off, leaving Sol
holding the towel. He patted
his face, and then scrubbed
the wet tangle of brown hair.
Carefully, he stepped off the
carpet and onto the stone
floor in front of the fireplace.
He removed his
drenched coat and suit jacket,
and squeezed water out
over the ashes.</p>

<p>He stripped down to his
underwear, wondering about
next morning's possible embarrassment,
and decided to
use the damp bath towel as a
blanket. The sofa was downy
and comfortable. He curled
up under the towel, shivered
once, and closed his eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">He</span> was tired and very
sleepy, and his customary
nightly review was limited to
a few detached thoughts
about the wedding he was
supposed to attend in Salinas
that weekend ... the hoodlum
who had responded to his
good-nature by dumping him
out of his own car ... the slogging
walk to the village ...
the little round woman who
was hurrying off, like the
White Rabbit, to some mysterious
appointment on the
upper floor ...</p>

<p>Then he went to sleep.</p>

<p>A voice awoke him, shrill
and questioning.</p>

<p>"Are you <i>nakkid</i>?"</p>

<p>His eyes flew open, and he
pulled the towel protectively
around his body and glared
at the little girl with the rust-red
pigtails.</p>

<p>"Huh, mister?" she said,
pushing a finger against her
freckled nose. "Are you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said angrily. "I'm
not naked. Will you please
go away?"</p>

<p>"Sally!" It was Mom, appearing
in the doorway of the
parlor. "You leave the gentleman
alone." She went off
again.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sol said. "Please let
me get dressed. If you don't
mind." The girl didn't move.
"What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Dunno," Sally shrugged.
"I like poached eggs. They're
my favorite eggs in the whole
world."</p>

<p>"That's good," Sol said desperately.
"Now why don't you
be a good girl and eat your
poached eggs. In the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Ain't ready yet. You going
to stay for breakfast?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to do anything
until you get out of
here."</p>

<p>She put the end of a pigtail
in her mouth and sat down on
the chair opposite. "I went to
the palace last night. They
had an exelution."</p>

<p>"Please," Sol groaned. "Be
a good girl, Sally. If you let
me get dressed, I'll show you
how to take your thumb off."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's an old trick. Did
you ever see an exelution?"</p>

<p>"No. Did you ever see a little
girl with her hide
tanned?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sally!</i>" Mom again, sterner.
"You get out of there, or
you-know-what ..."</p>

<p>"Okay," the girl said
blithely. "I'm goin' to the palace
again. If I brush my
teeth. Aren't you <i>ever</i> gonna
get up?" She skipped out of
the room, and Sol hastily sat
up and reached for his
trousers.</p>

<p>When he had dressed, the
clothes still damp and unpleasant
against his skin, he
went out of the parlor and
found the kitchen. Mom was
busy at the stove. He said:
"Good morning."</p>

<p>"Breakfast in ten minutes,"
she said cheerfully. "You like
poached eggs?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Do you have a telephone?"</p>

<p>"In the hallway. Party line,
so you may have to wait."</p>

<p>He tried for fifteen minutes
to get through, but there
was a woman on the line who
was terribly upset about a
cotton dress she had ordered
from Sears, and was telling
the world about it.</p>

<p>Finally, he got his call
through to Salinas, and a
sleepy-voiced Fred, his old
Army buddy, listened somewhat
indifferently to his tale
of woe. "I might miss the
wedding," Sol said unhappily.
"I'm awfully sorry." Fred
didn't seem to be half as sorry
as he was. When Sol hung
up, he was feeling more despondent
than ever.</p>

<p>A man, tall and rangy, with
a bobbing Adam's apple and
a lined face, came into the
hallway. "Hullo?" he said inquiringly.
"You the fella had
the car stolen?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The man scratched his ear.
"Take you over to Sheriff
Coogan after breakfast. He'll
let the Stateys know about it.
My name's Dawes."</p>

<p>Sol accepted a careful
handshake.</p>

<p>"Don't get many people
comin' into town," Dawes
said, looking at him curiously.
"Ain't seen a stranger in
years. But you look like the
rest of us." He chuckled.</p>

<p>Mom called out: "Breakfast!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">At</span> the table, Dawes
asked his destination.</p>

<p>"Wedding in Salinas," he
explained. "Old Army friend
of mine. I picked this hitchhiker
up about two miles from
here. He <i>seemed</i> okay."</p>

<p>"Never can tell," Dawes
said placidly, munching egg.
"Hey, Ma. That why you
were so late comin' to court
last night?"</p>

<p>"That's right, Pa." She
poured the blackest coffee
Sol had ever seen. "Didn't
miss much, though."</p>

<p>"What court is that?" Sol
asked politely, his mouth full.</p>

<p>"Umagum," Sally said, a
piece of toast sticking out
from the side of her mouth.
"Don't you know <i>nothin'</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>Arma</i>gon," Dawes corrected.
He looked sheepishly at
the stranger. "Don't expect
Mister&mdash;" He cocked an eyebrow.
"What's the name?"</p>

<p>"Becker."</p>

<p>"Don't expect Mr. Becker
knows anything about Armagon.
It's just a dream, you
know." He smiled apologetically.</p>

<p>"Dream? You mean this&mdash;Armagon
is a place you dream
about?"</p>

<p>"Yep," Dawes said. He lifted
cup to lip. "Great coffee,
Ma." He leaned back with a
contented sigh. "Dream about
it every night. Got so used to
the place, I get all confused
in the daytime."</p>

<p>Mom said: "I get muddle-headed
too, sometimes."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" Sol put his
napkin in his lap. "You mean
<i>you</i> dream about the same
place?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Sally piped. "We
all go there at night. I'm goin'
to the palace again, too."</p>

<p>"If you brush your teeth,"
Mom said primly.</p>

<p>"If I brush my teeth. Boy,
you shoulda seen the exelution!"</p>

<p>"Execution," her father
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" Mom
got up hastily. "That reminds
me. I gotta call poor Mrs.
Brundage. It's the <i>least</i> I
could do."</p>

<p>"Good idea," Dawes nodded.
"And I'll have to round
up some folks and get old
Brundage out of there."</p>

<p>Sol was staring. He opened
his mouth, but couldn't think
of the right question to ask.
Then he blurted out: "What
execution?"</p>

<p>"None of <i>your</i> business,"
the man said coldly. "You eat
up, young man. If you want
me to get Sheriff Coogan
lookin' for your car."</p>

<p>The rest of the meal went
silently, except for Sally's insistence
upon singing her
school song between mouthfuls.
When Dawes was
through, he pushed back his
plate and ordered Sol to get
ready.</p>

<p>Sol grabbed his topcoat and
followed the man out the
door.</p>

<p>"Have to stop someplace
first," Dawes said. "But we'll
be pickin' up the Sheriff on
the way. Okay with you?"</p>

<p>"Fine," Sol said uneasily.</p>

<p>The rain had stopped, but
the heavy clouds seemed reluctant
to leave the skies over
the small town. There was a
skittish breeze blowing, and
Sol Becker tightened the collar
of his coat around his
neck as he tried to keep up
with the fast-stepping Dawes.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">They</span> crossed the
street diagonally, and entered
a two-story wooden building.
Dawes took the stairs at a
brisk pace, and pushed open
the door on the second floor.
A fat man looked up from
behind a desk.</p>

<p>"Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd
see if you wanted to help
move Brundage."</p>

<p>The man batted his eyes.
"Oh, Brundage!" he said.
"You know, I clean forgot
about him?" He laughed.
"Imagine me forgetting
that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Dawes wasn't
amused. "And you Prince Regent."</p>

<p>"Aw, Willie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, come on. Stir that
fat carcass. Gotta pick up
Sheriff Coogan, too. This
here gentleman has to see him
about somethin' else."</p>

<p>The man regarded Sol suspiciously.
"Never seen you
before. Night <i>or</i> day. Stranger?"</p>

<p>"Come <i>on</i>!" Dawes said.</p>

<p>The fat man grunted and
hoisted himself out of the
swivel chair. He followed
lamely behind the two men
as they went out into the
street again.</p>

<p>A woman, with an empty
market basket, nodded casually
to them. "Mornin', folks.
Enjoyed it last night.
Thought you made a right
nice speech, Mr. Dawes."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Dawes answered
gruffly, but obviously flattered.
"We were just goin'
over to Brundage's to pick up
the body. Ma's gonna pay a
call on Mrs. Brundage around
ten o'clock. You care to visit?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think that's very
nice," the woman said. "I'll
be sure and do that." She
smiled at the fat man. "Mornin',
Prince."</p>

<p>Sol's head was spinning. As
they left the woman and continued
their determined
march down the quiet street,
he tried to find answers.</p>

<p>"Look, Mr. Dawes." He was
panting; the pace was fast.
"Does <i>she</i> dream about this&mdash;Armagon,
too? That woman
back there?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>Charlie chuckled. "He's a
stranger, all right."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr.&mdash;" Sol
turned to the fat man. "You
also know about this palace
and everything?"</p>

<p>"I told you," Dawes said
testily. "Charlie here's Prince
Regent. But don't let the fancy
title fool you. He got no
more power than any Knight
of the Realm. He's just too
dern fat to do much more'n
sit on a throne and eat grapes.
That right, Charlie?"</p>

<p>The fat man giggled.</p>

<p>"Here's the Sheriff," Dawes
said.</p>

<p>The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed
citizen with a long, sad face,
was rocking on a porch as
they approached his house,
trying to puff a half-lit pipe.
He lifted one hand wearily
when he saw them.</p>

<p>"Hi, Cookie," Dawes
grinned. "Thought you, me,
and Charlie would get Brundage's
body outa the house.
This here's Mr. Becker; he
got another problem. Mr.
Becker, meet Cookie Coogan."</p>

<p>The Sheriff joined the procession,
pausing only once to
inquire into Sol's predicament.</p>

<p>He described the hitchhiker
incident, but Coogan
listened stoically. He murmured
something about the
Troopers, and shuffled alongside
the puffing fat man.</p>

<p>Sol soon realized that their
destination was a barber shop.</p>

<p>Dawes cupped his hands
over the plate glass and
peered inside. Gold letters on
the glass advertised: HAIRCUT
SHAVE &amp; MASSAGE
PARLOR. He reported: "Nobody
in the shop. Must be
upstairs."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">The</span> fat man rang the
bell. It was a while before an
answer came.</p>

<p>It was a reedy woman in a
housecoat, her hair in curlers,
her eyes red and swollen.</p>

<p>"Now, now," Dawes said
gently. "Don't you take on
like that, Mrs. Brundage. You
heard the charges. It hadda
be this way."</p>

<p>"My poor Vincent," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>"Better let us up," the
Sheriff said kindly. "No use
just lettin' him lay there,
Mrs. Brundage."</p>

<p>"He didn't mean no harm,"
the woman snuffled. "He was
just purely ornery, Vincent
was. Just plain mean stubborn."</p>

<p>"The law's the law," the
fat man sighed.</p>

<p>Sol couldn't hold himself
in.</p>

<p>"What law? Who's dead?
How did it happen?"</p>

<p>Dawes looked at him disgustedly.
"Now is it any of
<i>your</i> business? I mean, is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Sol said
miserably.</p>

<p>"You better stay out of
this," the Sheriff warned.
"This is a local matter, young
man. You better stay in the
shop while we go up."</p>

<p>They filed past him and the
crying Mrs. Brundage.</p>

<p>When they were out of
sight, Sol pleaded with her.</p>

<p>"What happened? How did
your husband die?"</p>

<p>"Please ..."</p>

<p>"You must tell me! Was it
something to do with Armagon?
Do you dream about the
place, too?"</p>

<p>She was shocked at the
question. "Of course!"</p>

<p>"And your husband? Did
he have the same dream?"</p>

<p>Fresh tears resulted. "Can't
you leave me alone?" She
turned her back. "I got things
to do. You can make yourself
comfortable&mdash;" She indicated
the barber chairs, and left
through the back door.</p>

<p>Sol looked after her, and
then ambled over to the first
chair and slipped into the
high seat. His reflection in
the mirror, strangely gray in
the dim light, made him
groan. His clothes were a
mess, and he needed a shave.
If only Brundage had been
alive ...</p>

<p>He leaped out of the chair
as voices sounded behind the
door. Dawes was kicking it
open with his foot, his arms
laden with two rather large
feet, still encased in bedroom
slippers. Charlie was at the
other end of the burden,
which appeared to be a middle-aged
man in pajamas. The
Sheriff followed the trio up
with a sad, undertaker expression.
Behind him came Mrs.
Brundage, properly weeping.</p>

<p>"We'll take him to the funeral
parlor," Dawes said,
breathing hard. "Weighs a
ton, don't he?"</p>

<p>"What killed him?" Sol
said.</p>

<p>"Heart attack."</p>

<p>The fat man chuckled.</p>

<p>The tableau was grisly. Sol
looked away, towards the
comfortingly mundane atmosphere
of the barber shop. But
even the sight of the thick-padded
chairs, the shaving
mugs on the wall, the neat
rows of cutting instruments,
seemed grotesque and morbid.</p>

<p>"Listen," Sol said, as they
went through the doorway.
"About my car&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Sheriff turned and regarded
him lugubriously.
"Your <i>car</i>? Young man, ain't
you got no <i>respect</i>?"</p>

<p>Sol swallowed hard and fell
silent. He went outside with
them, the woman slamming
the barber-shop door behind
him. He waited in front of
the building while the men
toted away the corpse to some
new destination.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">He</span> took a walk.</p>

<p>The town was just coming
to life. People were strolling
out of their houses, commenting
on the weather, chuckling
amiably about local affairs.
Kids on bicycles were beginning
to appear, jangling the
little bells and hooting to
each other. A woman, hanging
wash in the back yard,
called out to him, thinking
he was somebody else.</p>

<p>He found a little park, no
more than twenty yards in
circumference, centered
around a weatherbeaten monument
of some unrecognizable
military figure. Three
old men took their places on
the bench that circled the
General, and leaned on their
canes.</p>

<p>Sol was a civil engineer.
But he made like a reporter.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir." The old
man, leathery-faced, with a
fine yellow moustache, looked
at him dumbly. "Have you
ever heard of Armagon?"</p>

<p>"You a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thought so."</p>

<p>Sol repeated the question.</p>

<p>"Course I did. Been goin'
there ever since I was a kid.
Night-times, that is."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;I mean, what kind
of place is it?"</p>

<p>"Said you're a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then 'tain't your business."</p>

<p>That was that.</p>

<p>He left the park, and wandered
into a thriving luncheonette.
He tried questioning
the man behind the counter,
who merely snickered and
said: "You stayin' with the
Dawes, ain't you? Better ask
Willie, then. He knows the
place better than anybody."</p>

<p>He asked about the execution,
and the man stiffened.</p>

<p>"Don't think I can talk
about that. Fella broke one of
the Laws; that's about it.
Don't see where you come
into it."</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock, he returned
to the Dawes residence,
and found Mom in the
kitchen, surrounded by the
warm nostalgic odor of home-baked
bread. She told him
that her husband had left a
message for the stranger, informing
him that the State
Police would be around to get
his story.</p>

<p>He waited in the house,
gloomily turning the pages of
the local newspaper, searching
for references to Armagon.
He found nothing.</p>

<p>At eleven-thirty, a brown-faced
State Trooper came to
call, and Sol told his story.
He was promised nothing,
and told to stay in town until
he was contacted again by
the authorities.</p>

<p>Mom fixed him a light
lunch, the greatest feature of
which was some hot biscuits
she plucked out of the oven.
It made him feel almost normal.</p>

<p>He wandered around the
town some more after lunch,
trying to spark conversation
with the residents.</p>

<p>He learned little.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">At</span> five-thirty, he returned
to the Dawes house, and was
promptly leaped upon by
little Sally.</p>

<p>"Hi! Hi! Hi!" she said,
clutching his right leg and
almost toppling him over.
"We had a party in school. I
had chocolate cake. You goin'
to stay with us?"</p>

<p>"Just another night," Sol
told her, trying to shake the
girl off. "If it's okay with
your folks. They haven't
found my car yet."</p>

<p>"Sally!" Mom was peering
out of the screen door. "You
let Mr. Becker alone and go
wash. Your Pa will be home
soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh," the girl said,
her pigtails swinging. "Do
you got a girlfriend, mister?"</p>

<p>"No." Sol struggled towards
the house with her
dead weight on his leg.
"Would you mind? I can't
walk."</p>

<p>"Would you be my boyfriend?"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll talk about it.
If you let go my leg."</p>

<p>Inside the house, she said:
"We're having pot roast. You
stayin'?"</p>

<p>"Of course Mr. Becker's
stayin'," Mom said. "He's our
guest."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you,"
Sol said. "I really wish you'd
let me pay something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't want to hear another
word about pay."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">Mr. Dawes</span> came home an
hour later, looking tired.
Mom pecked him lightly on
the forehead. He glanced at
the evening paper, and then
spoke to Sol.</p>

<p>"Hear you been asking
questions, Mr. Becker."</p>

<p>Sol nodded, embarrassed.
"Guess I have. I'm awfully
curious about this Armagon
place. Never heard of anything
like it before."</p>

<p>Dawes grunted. "You ain't
a reporter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I
was just satisfying my own
curiosity."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh." Dawes looked
reflective. "You wouldn't be
thinkin' about writing us up
or anything. I mean, this is a
pretty private affair."</p>

<p>"Writing it up?" Sol
blinked. "I hadn't thought of
it. But you'll have to admit&mdash;it's
sure interesting."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Dawes said narrowly.
"I guess it would be."</p>

<p>"Supper!" Mom called.</p>

<p>After the meal, they spent
a quiet evening at home. Sally
went to bed, screaming her
reluctance, at eight-thirty.
Mom, dozing in the big chair
near the fireplace, padded upstairs
at nine. Then Dawes
yawned widely, stood up, and
said goodnight at quarter-of-ten.</p>

<p>He paused in the doorway
before leaving.</p>

<p>"I'd think about that," he
said. "Writing it up, I mean.
A lot of folks would think
you were just plum crazy."</p>

<p>Sol laughed feebly. "I
guess they would at that."</p>

<p>"Goodnight," Dawes said.</p>

<p>"Goodnight."</p>

<p>He read Sally's copy of
<i>Treasure Island</i> for about
half an hour. Then he undressed,
made himself comfortable
on the sofa, snuggled
under the soft blanket
that Mom had provided, and
shut his eyes.</p>

<p>He reviewed the events of
the day before dropping off
to sleep. The troublesome
Sally. The strange dream
world of Armagon. The visit
to the barber shop. The removal
of Brundage's body.
The conversations with the
townspeople. Dawes' suspicious
attitude ...</p>

<p>Then sleep came.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">He</span> was flanked by marble
pillars, thrusting towards
a high-domed ceiling.</p>

<p>The room stretched long
and wide before him, the
walls bedecked in stunning
purple draperies.</p>

<p>He whirled at the sound of
footsteps, echoing stridently
on the stone floor. Someone
was running towards him.</p>

<p>It was Sally, pigtails
streaming out behind her, the
small body wearing a flowing
white toga. She was shrieking,
laughing as she skittered
past him, clutching a gleaming
gold helmet.</p>

<p>He called out to her, but
she was too busy outdistancing
her pursuer. It was Sheriff
Coogan, puffing and huffing,
the metal-and-gold cloth
uniform ludicrous on his
lanky frame.</p>

<p>"Consarn kid!" he wheezed.
"Gimme my hat!"</p>

<p>Mom was following him,
her stout body regal in scarlet
robes. "Sally! You give
Sir Coogan his helmet! You
hear?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dawes!" Sol said.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Becker! How
nice to see you again! Pa!
<i>Pa!</i> Look who's here!"</p>

<p>Willie Dawes appeared.
<i>No!</i> Sol thought. This was
<i>King</i> Dawes; nothing else
could explain the magnificence
of his attire.</p>

<p>"Yes," Dawes said craftily.
"So I see. Welcome to Armagon,
Mr. Becker."</p>

<p>"Armagon?" Sol gaped.
"Then this is the place
you've been dreaming about?"</p>

<p>"Yep," the King said. "And
now <i>you're</i> in it, too."</p>

<p>"Then I'm only dreaming!"</p>

<p>Charlie, the fat man,
clumsy as ever in his robes of
State, said: "So <i>that's</i> the
snooper, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yep," Dawes chuckled.
"Think you better round up
the Knights."</p>

<p>Sol said: "The Knights?"</p>

<p>"Exelution! Exelution!"
Sally shrieked.</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>Charlie shouted.</p>

<p>Running feet, clanking of
armor. Sol backed up against
a pillar. "Now look here.
You've gone far enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not quite," said the King.</p>

<p>The Knights stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Sol screamed.</p>

<p>Familiar faces, under shining
helmets, moved towards
him; the tips of sharp-pointed
spears gleaming wickedly.
And Sol Becker wondered&mdash;would
he ever awake?</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
